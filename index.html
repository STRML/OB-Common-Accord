					<li><u>Arbitration</u>. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT
					REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE
					PARTIES CAN SEEK RELIEF.<br />
					The parties agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating
					to the Site, except that the parties are not required to arbitrate any dispute in
					which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use
					of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents.
					ARBITRATION PREVENTS THE PARTIES FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.
					The parties agree that the parties will notify each other of any dispute within
					thirty (30) days of when it arises, that the parties will attempt informal
					resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur
					in Chicago, Illinois and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a
					single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS. The parties also agree
					that the state or federal courts in Cook County, Illinois have exclusive
					jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between
					the parties not subject to arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not
					seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to
					engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting
					their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final
					hearing. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator
					has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court.
					Neither party will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for
					any claims covered by these Terms. The parties also agree not to participate in
					claims brought in an private attorney general or representative capacity, or
					consolidated claims involving another person, if the other party is a party to
					the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought
					on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then
					that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from the Terms and the
					remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and
					effect.</li>

					<li><u>Governing Law</u><br />
					This Escrow Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws
					of Illinois without reference to its internal choice of law rules.</li>

					<li><u>Notices</u>.<br />
					All notices under this Agreement shall be delivered by electronic message using
					the "blockchain" technology through which this Agreement was entered.</li>

					<li><u>Construction to Conform to Technical Implementation</u><br />
					The provisions of this Agreement are intended to express in legal language
					("Text") the functioning of the software code that performs the transaction. Each
					party represents that it has access to the source code ("Code") and has made such
					inspection and analysis as it deems appropriate. In the event of any ambiguity in
					the text or conflict between the text and operation of the Code, the Code will be
					the definitive version.</li>
