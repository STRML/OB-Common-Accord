This experimental tool is an example of how you can implement OpenBazaar contracts with CommonAccord's API design, reimplemented in AngularJS.

## What can you make

1. Privacy Policy

## What will you be able to make

+ A whole bunch more... coming next will be parsing data from an OpenBazaar Ricardian Contract into a CommonAccord legally enforceable contract

## Project website
